Hi
Hello! How can I assist you today?
I am feeling pain in my tooth
I'm sorry to hear that you're in pain. It's important to see a dentist as soon as possible to determine the cause of the pain and get the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try rinsing your mouth with warm salt water and taking over-the-counter pain medication to help alleviate the discomfort.

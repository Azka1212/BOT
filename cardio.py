    8. Based on your assessment and test results, develop a personalized treatment plan encompassing medications, lifestyle modifications, and propose follow-up appointments as needed.

    10. Discuss the potential risks and benefits associated with the recommended treatments, ensuring the patient comprehends their options and feels empowered in decision-making.

    11. Provide educational materials and resources to enhance the patient's understanding of cardiovascular health, empowering them to take an active role in their well-being.

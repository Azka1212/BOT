The line sessions[user_name] = UserSession(user_name) in your FastAPI code does the following:

sessions is a dictionary that keeps track of user sessions in your chatbot application.
user_name is a unique identifier for each user interacting with the chatbot.
UserSession(user_name) creates a new instance of the UserSession class, which represents a session for a specific user.
sessions[user_name] = ... stores this new UserSession instance in the sessions dictionary, associating it with the user's unique identifier (user_name).
So, when a new user interacts with your chatbot through FastAPI, this line ensures that a new session is created specifically for that user, allowing the chatbot to keep track of the conversation history and maintain context between interactions for that user.
